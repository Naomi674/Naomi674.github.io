    <p>I chose this program because technology is the way of the future and the only way to make an impact on the world going forward is to have a good understanding of technology. I also chose this program because I love learning, so much so that when it came to picking something to study I had a very hard time deciding because in my mind everything was important and worth studying. I finally landed on ICT because I figured that with ICT I have the flexibility and opportunities to move from one path to another so I can continue to learn about a wide variety of things instead of being pinned down. As for what I want to do after I graduate I donâ€™t have a clear idea just yet. As of right now I am planning on taking the data science route and I would like to apply that to non-business related things like working in the medical industry or sustainable agriculture. 
        I did research on different universities and decided that this program spoke to me the most.
