        <p>At the company safari the first presentation that I attended was by a company named Damen Navel Technologies, which is a company whose main focus is building ships. Out of all of the companies that I learned about at the safari this one was my favorite. This company stood out to me because their ICT work wasn’t just for ICT, it was part of a larger goal that the company was working towards and the work wasn’t abstract, you could see the results of the work that was put in. I also liked this company because it seemed to have a close knit family feel to the working environment. Unfortunately because I am from the United States I can’t work at Damen for a while, but I was still able to learn a lot about what I want from a company when it comes time for my internship. The second presentation that I attended at the company safari was by a company named Veracode. The focus of this company is creating secure software for different businesses. I did not like this presentation nearly as much as I liked Damen’s. Maybe it was just because this presentation was online,  but I had a hard time being invested in the work that was being described. I find cyber security fascinating but I just didn’t vibe as much with the working environment that was being described. </p>
