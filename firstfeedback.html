    <p>Thank you for uploading your form.  you have seemed to choose an education based on future possibilities which are certainly true but keep in mind that you also need to enjoy what you study otherwise it becomes hard to keep up with it, especially since these are more long term goals. So find some intrinsic motivation too.  how much did you enjoy the cybersecurity class?
        Procrastination is no stranger to anyone, and you might have some challenges here and there because programming (especially the course object-oriented programming) might be a tough one,. Just team up with fellow students and you'll make it through.
        A good question to ask in regards to math. You'll find that in your second year there are some statistical calculations done for data science however we have computers for that ;-) So mostly it is more about understanding what it means and interpreting, not so much the actual doing of math.</p>
