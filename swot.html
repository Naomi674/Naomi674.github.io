            <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> I am very coachable,  so much so that in the past my coaches have had to watch what they say around me because I will over correct. I am also very good at doing detailed oriented almost monotonous tasks. I find them very therapeutic, to an extent of course.
                <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> I have a tendency to procrastinate when I no longer find a task challenging or worth doing. For the most part I always get my work done it just sometimes feels like Iâ€™m pulling my teeth out.
                <strong>Opportunities:</strong>  My coachablity makes me a good student who can pick things up quickly. Which is good when it comes to having to learn new programming languages 
                <strong>Threats:</strong> I procrastinate a lot so often I become overwhelmed which makes the quality of my work lower than what I am capable of.
