            <p>I attended a very small high school growing up. In fact it was so small that it didn’t offer many classes outside of the required Michigan curriculum because it didn’t have enough students to fill up the extra classes. As a result, I didn’t have access to any programming classes through my school. Once I finished taking all of the classes my school offered I was able to take extra classes through a local community college and a tech center. At the tech center I did take a cyber security and computer networking class, however it was cut short due to COVID so we only got to the hardware side of computers and very basic command line. I did very much enjoy this class, I just didn’t learn as much as I would have liked to because once we moved to online classes the WiFi where I lived was so bad that it made running all of the applications that I would have needed to nearly impossible.
