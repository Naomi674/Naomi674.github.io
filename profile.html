        <h1>My Profile!</h1>
        <p>My name is Naomi Norris and I am 18 years old. During high school I received the standard American high school diploma, and I took some cyber security classes at a different school my junior year.</p>
        <p>I chose this program because computers are the way of the future and the only way to make an impact on the world going forward is to have a good understanding of computers.  I also chose this program because it can be applied to a wide varity of things. Lastly, I chose this program becuase there are a lot of job opportunities. </p>
        <p>I am not sure exactly what I want to do after I complete the program. As of right now I plan on taking the data science route and applying it to something non-business related like the medical feild or sustainable agriculture.</p>
        <p>In my free time I really like to read and go for runs. I also like watching movies and doing different crafty things like knitting. I also had a job at an ice cream shop back home.</p>
